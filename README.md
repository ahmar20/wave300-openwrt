# wave300-dev
WAVE300 Driver Development for OpenWrt

Clone the repo and change the Makefile to set some variables depending on your system.
After that just run the `make` and the `wav300_driver.ko` should be in the base directory with other object files.

Build has been tested with OpenWrt v18.06.4 r7808
